    Alice was beginning to get very tired  of sitting by her sister on the bank,
and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sis-
ter was reading,  but it had no pictures or  conversations in it,  `and what is 
the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'

    So she was considering  in her own mind  (as well as she could, for the hot
day made her feel  very sleepy and  stupid),  whether the pleasure  of making a
daisy-chain would be  worth the trouble of  getting up and  picking the daisies,
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

    There was  nothing so very  remarkable in that;  nor did Alice  think it so
very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I
shall be late!'  (when she thought it over afterwards,  it occurred to her that
she ought to have  wondered at this,  but at the time  it all seemed quite natu-
ral);  but when the  Rabbit actually  took a watch out of  its waistcoat-pocket,
and looked  at it,  and then  hurried on,  Alice  started  to her feet,  for it
flashed across her mind  that she had never before seen a rabbit  with either a
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she
ran across the field after it,  and fortunately was just in time  to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
